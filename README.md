## Usage via Terminal
![bindhosts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3e3f2c-9039-417d-8652-77f48755c7bf)

In order to access the various options as shown in the image for bindhosts magisk/KSU/Apatch, you must first have su access via command line either through termux (or other various common terminal apps)
or adb shell and type: bindhosts followed by the option you want.

EXAMPLE: 
         
         bindhosts --action ---> This will simulate bindhosts action to grab ips or reset the hosts file, depending on which state bindhosts is in
         bindhosts --tcpdump ---> Will sniff current active ip addresses on your network mode (wifi or data, make sure no DNS services are being used like cloudflare, etc.)
         bindhosts --force-reset ---> Will force reset bindhosts, which means resets the host file to zero ips
         bindhosts --custom-cron ---> Defines time of day to run a cronjob for bindhosts
         bindhosts --enable-cron ---> Enables cronjob task for bindhosts to update the ips of the lists you are currently using at 10am (default time)
         bindhosts --disable-cron ---> Disables & deletes previously set cronjob task for bindhosts
         bindhosts --help ---> This will show everything as shown above in image and text
